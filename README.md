# Overview

A simple habit tracker console app in rust, to get to know the language. It has a menu that you select from by typing numbers. You can add habits and journal entries for those habits, and it will keep track of them and add the date the entry was made.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode with the Rust Analyzer extension, as well as rust's command line project setup.

# Future Work

- Make it save to a text file and then read from the file upon starting.
